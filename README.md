1. Spike: Research APIs

User Story: As a user, I want to ... so ...

AS A reader
I WANT to browse the New York Times bestseller lists by category and date
SO THAT I may select a book to read

GIVEN a bestseller dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a date and category
THEN I am presented with book titles and covers for that category list on or after that date
WHEN I click on a book
THEN I am presented with detailed information on that book, including reviews
WHEN I click on a buy link
THEN I am presented with a drop-down list of buying options
WHEN I click on a borrow link
THEN I am referred to the New York Public Library

2. Spike: Research UI framework

Materialize? Sort of clumsy but not too bad.

I can't figure out how to use Material UI Kit

Using foundation

3. Create repository in git, give access to your teammates

4. Create mock payload from api

var payload = {
    { city: 'New York', zipCode: '10001' }
};

5. Create mock html with mock payload
6. Create css classes with mock html + payload
7. Create javascript code to build page dynamically (can be multiple functions each can be its own task or not)

If html is large then repeat task 5, 6 and 7 with other data

Google Books API
Penguin Publishing API

As a reader, I want to keep track of the books in my library, SO I may find new books I might like.

As a reader, I want to view a list of New York Times Bestsellers by date, SO I may read reviews and select a book to read and buy it.
